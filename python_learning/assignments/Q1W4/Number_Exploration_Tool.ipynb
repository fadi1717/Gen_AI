    "1. To determine if a number is prime, start by ensuring the number is greater than 1.\n",
    "2. If it's 2 or 3, it's prime.\n",
    "3. For numbers greater than 3, first check if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If it is, the number is not prime.\n",
    "4. Next, calculate the square root of the number and round down to the nearest whole number.\n",
    "5. Check for divisibility by numbers starting from 5 up to the square root of the number.\n",
    "6. Focus on numbers of the form 6k±1 (like 5, 7, 11, etc.). If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.\n",
    "7. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.\n",

    "2. 19 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd) and not divisible by 3.\n",
    "3. The square root of 19 is approximately 4.36, so we only need to check divisibility by 5 (since 5 is the only number of the form\n",
    "4. 6k±1 up to 4.36).\n",
    "5. 19 is not divisible by 5.\n",
    "6. Since 19 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.\n"
