2. **SDK**: A toolkit with all you need to build apps for a specific platform, like code libraries and guides.

3. **Web APIs**: APIs that work over the internet to connect apps with online services.

4. **Library APIs**: Ready-made code tools you can use in your program to save time and effort.

5. **Prompting and Completion**: Giving an AI a question or task (prompt) and getting its answer or solution (completion).
