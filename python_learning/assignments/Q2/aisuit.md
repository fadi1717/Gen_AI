Here’s why Gemini can’t be used with `aisuite`:

1. **Not Supported**: Gemini is not listed as a supported provider in `aisuite`.
2. **Provider Format**: The client expects a provider like "openai" or "huggingface," not "gemini."
3. **No Integration**: `aisuite` does not have built-in support for the Gemini API.
4. **API Credentials**: You’d need special API credentials for Gemini, which aren’t set up in `aisuite` yet.
